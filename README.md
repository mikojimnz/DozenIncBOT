# Mafia: MI6 VS The Twelve

**Who will survive? MI6 or The Twelve ?!**

Play against other members to find out who amongst each other you can trust and who will betray you. Adapted from the card game *Mafia* played in 3x05. Only the stealthy and cunning will survive.

**Objective:** Eliminate as many of the opposing team as possible. The team with more survivors wins.

**How To Play**

*It is not recommended to play on mobile web. Please use Reddit Desktop, official Reddit App, or third party client that supports live chat.*

1. Each user is given a secret role. You cannot see each otherâ€™s roles. You may choose to bluff or try to be truthful. Introduce yourself at the beginning of the game to set the scene.
2. You must investigate each other to determine who is on what side.
3. During the Day, MI6 agents can investigate and kill users who they suspect are in The Twelve. During the Night, The Twelve can investigate and kill users who they suspect are in MI6. **Each Cycle lasts 6 hours. 2 Day/Night Rounds, 4 Cycles per day.**
4. **A user must receive at least 2 votes to be executed**. Teams members are not immune to each other. You may end up killing your own team members out of suspicion. Users who do not actively participate in the investigation may not use the !vote or !digup commands.
5. At the end of each cycle, an announcement will be made how many people are alive how many were killed.
6. You must choose your allies carefully to seek out the enemy.

**Tips:**

* You do not need to make a new PM for each command. Simply reply to any existing PM from the bot.
* Investigators can use the !digup command multiple times times on the same user to get a better picture of their role.
