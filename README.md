# Mafia: MI6 VS The Twelve V2

**Who will survive? MI6 or The Twelve ?!**

Play against other members to find out who amongst each other you can trust and who will betray you. Adapted from the card game *Mafia* played in 3x05. Only the stealthy and cunning will survive.

**Objective:** Eliminate as many of the opposing team as possible. The team with more survivors wins.

**How To Play**

*It is not recommended to play on mobile web. Please use Reddit Desktop, official Reddit App, or third party client that supports live chat.*

1. Each user is assigned to either MI6 or the Twelve.
2. You must investigate each other to determine who is on what side and eliminate the opponent.
3. Decipher and decrypt the clues provided in order to advance your rank and unlock more powerful investigation tools.
4. Vote out players who you suspect are the enemy. A player must receive a certain number of hits in order to be killed. After a certain amount of time, the number of votes required will be lowered to 1. Votes, aka hits, only last per round.
4. At the end of each round, an announcement will be made how many people are alive how many were killed.
5. You must choose your allies carefully to seek out the enemy.

**Tips:**

- This is a passive game, you are not required to be on actively. However, users who are inactive for more than 48 hours will be kicked.
- It is recommended that you use Reddit Desktop Redesign, official Reddit apps, or third party app client that supports Reddit's Live Chat feature.
- You do not need to make a new PM for each command. Simply reply to any existing PM from the bot.
- Working in pairs is the ultimate way to win! But who can you trust?
- Use the !digup command multiple times on the same user to get a better picture of their role.
- If you are not able to use a command because you are getting a comment participation message, use a different command, such as !stats, to refresh the database so that it pulls the latest information. Note: It may take Reddit up to 30 seconds to update its comments.
