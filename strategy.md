# The Politics of Working with the Enemy
*The ultimate way to Win*

While the game seems pretty simple in nature, there is much more at work than what meets the eye. Two foes working in the shadows to deliberately undermine one another. Sometimes it may take a trip to hell and back in order to survive.

## Gathering Intelligence

Intelligence can be gathered in five ways in this game.

1. `!digup`: The `digup` command will give an *Intelligence Report* on what a user's role is. However with any piece of intelligence, there is uncertainty to its reliability. *Assassins* and *Operatives* can use the `digup` command, but with greater unreliability. They must rely on *Handlers* and *Analysts* to aid them in obtaining reliable information.
2. `!locate`: The `locate` command gives the present location of a player. These locations have meaning tied to them based on the events of the Show. You may be able to determine what side someone is working for, but not their role, based on their location.
3. `!request`: The `request` command sends an anonymous request to the game thread for help obtaining intelligence on the user specified. *Anyone* can answer the request in the thread... *Anyone* could make up a report to throw other players off or to convince you to kill that person.
4. `!burn`: The `burn` command is the most effective and dangerous way to obtain information. It can only be used once and in the later stages of the game. This command will sacrifice one of your own members in exchange for 100% credible information about a member on the other team. There are severe consequences about this. By killing one of your own, you expose yourself to revenge and retribution.
5. Asking Directly: You can ask each other directly within the game thread or privately. Nothing is stopping them from lying to your face.

## Finding an Informant

A **critical** step in advancing through this game is finding an informant or even more than one. It is a very dangerous leap of faith trying to find someone you can tolerate to work with. That may require being a double agent and working with the enemy. *Assassins* and *Operatives* should definitely try to find a *Handler* or *Analyst* to get better intelligence. Having one more than one informant enables you to verify information is correct and eliminate those who may be feeding you bad info.

## Going for the Kill

Once you have found an informant, you can work together to coordinate kills and make sure your targets get eliminated.

## Burning Bridges & Leading your Team to Victory

***Keep your friends close, but your enemies closer.*** 

If you are getting desperate, you may burn your informants and team members in order to survive. This course of action is dangerous, but necessary if you find out that you may have been working with the enemy. Sometimes you may need to cut dead weight in order for the team to win as a whole.

## Be like Carolyn

Much of this game was modeled after Carolyn's behavior. Like all good agents, she knows how to navigate around the system to get information, trading intel from one agency to the other to get what she wants. This game is about **the politics of working with the enemy**.
